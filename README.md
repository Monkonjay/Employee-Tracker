## My process

### Built with

- node.js
- inquirer
- MySql


### What I learned

During this project, I practiced connecting node js with a MySQL dataabse and using inquirer to capture the user's input to query and update the database. 


```Javascript node.js, mySQL
  connection.query("INSERT INTO role SET ?", {
                title: response.title,
                salary: response.salary,
                department_id: response.departmentId
            })
```
