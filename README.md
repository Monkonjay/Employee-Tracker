## Overview

### The challenge
This application uses a third-party API, OpenWeather One Call to access weather data. I use the fetch method with specific parameters for the API call. The data is used to build a  weather dashboard that runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS using javaScript and jQuery.



### User Story

AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business

WHEN I start the application
THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
WHEN I choose to view all roles
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database

- CSS Bootstrap
- HTML5


### What I learned

The main lesson from this app is using api keys to make api calls and dynamically rendering the selected data to the browser. 


```Javascript
  // API url to get the city coordinates
  var cityCordinatesUrl = `https://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q=${targetCity}&limit=1&units=imperial&appid=${APIKey}`;
```
